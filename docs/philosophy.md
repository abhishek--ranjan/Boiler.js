# Philosophy

- HTML is the source of truth
- Explicit over implicit
- Layouts are first-class
- Security before rendering
- Framework stays small
- Long-term maintainability > short-term DX

These principles are immutable. They exist to ensure that every application built with Neo-UI is understandable, auditable, and secure by design.
