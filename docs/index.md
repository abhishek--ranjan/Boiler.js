# Neo-UI Framework

Neo-UI is an HTML-first, security-aware JavaScript UI framework designed for large-scale, long-lived, and regulated applications. It is for teams who value explicitness, auditability, and maintainability over trends or convenience. Neo-UI is not for those seeking rapid prototyping, experimental features, or build-tool-driven workflows. Core guarantees: HTML is always the source of truth, security is enforced by default, and the framework will remain stable and auditable for years. [See: overview.md]
