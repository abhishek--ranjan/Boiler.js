# FAQ

## Why not React?
- React is not HTML-first, requires build tools, and is not designed for long-term auditability.

## Is this modern?
- Modern in security, maintainability, and explicitness. Not trend-driven.

## Is it fast enough?
- Yes. All rendering is direct to DOM, no virtual DOM overhead.

## Can this scale?
- Yes. Designed for large, multi-year, multi-team projects.

## Is it secure by default?
- Yes. Security is enforced by the framework, not left to developer discretion.
