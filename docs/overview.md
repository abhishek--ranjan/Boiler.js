# Overview

Neo-UI exists to provide a clear, explicit, and secure foundation for enterprise, fintech, and government web applications. It rejects magic abstractions and build steps, focusing on long-term maintainability, security, and clarity. This framework is for teams who must pass audits, onboard new developers quickly, and maintain code for years. See philosophy.md for guiding principles.
